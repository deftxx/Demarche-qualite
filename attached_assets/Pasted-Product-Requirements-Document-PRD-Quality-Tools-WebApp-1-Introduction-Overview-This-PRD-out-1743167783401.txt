Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Quality Tools WebApp

1. Introduction
Overview
This PRD outlines the development of an interactive web application designed to teach and apply quality management and problem-solving tools (as described in the provided PDFs). The app will:

Educate users on key quality methodologies (Pareto, Ishikawa, 5 Whys, etc.).

Enable hands-on practice with interactive tools.

Support data export for further analysis.

Goals
Learning: Simplify complex quality concepts with structured courses.

Practicality: Provide real-world applications with sample datasets.

Flexibility: Allow data import/export and customization.

Target Users
Students (quality management, engineering).

Professionals (QA, operations, continuous improvement).

2. Core Features
2.1. Learning Modules
Content Structure:

Quality Fundamentals

Definition, history (Kano model, quality evolution).

Problem types (simple, complicated, complex).

DQRP (7-step problem-solving method).

Basic Tools

Pareto Chart: 80/20 rule, defect analysis.

Histogram: Data distribution visualization.

Ishikawa Diagram: Root cause analysis (5M framework).

5 Whys: Drill-down to root causes.

Flowchart: Process mapping.

Advanced Tools

Decision matrices, force field analysis, SWOT.

Format:

Text + visual aids (e.g., drag-and-drop Ishikawa builder).

Embedded quizzes (e.g., "Which tool best fits this scenario?").

2.2. Interactive Tools
MVP (V1):

Pareto Chart: Upload data → auto-generate chart highlighting top 20% issues.

5 Whys: Interactive tree builder (add/remove "Why" levels).

Histogram: Input data bins → visualize distribution.

V2 Enhancements:

Correlation Tool: Scatter plots from CSV data.

Flowchart Designer: Drag-and-drop process mapping.

Data Validation: Alerts for invalid inputs (e.g., insufficient data points).

2.3. Data Export
Formats:

CSV (for Excel/Power BI).

PNG/PDF (for reports).

Customization: Chart titles, colors, axis labels.

2.4. Error Handling
Clear Messaging:

"Minimum 5 data points required for a valid histogram."

"CSV must include ‘Frequency’ column."

Tooltips: "i" icons explaining input requirements.

3. Use Cases
3.1. Pareto Analysis
Scenario: A logistics manager analyzes delivery delays.
Steps:

Upload Supplier_Delays.csv.

App generates Pareto chart identifying top delay causes.

Export as PDF for stakeholder review.

3.2. 5 Whys
Scenario: Diagnosing a production line stoppage.
Steps:

Enter problem: "Machine stopped."

Add layers:

Why? → Overheating.

Why? → Failed coolant pump.

...

Export tree diagram for team discussion.

4. Roadmap
Version	Features
V1 (MVP)	Pareto, Histogram, 5 Whys, CSV/PNG export
V2	Ishikawa, Flowchart, data validation
V3	Decision matrices, API integrations (Google Sheets)
5. Technical Agnosticism
Frontend: Framework-agnostic (React/Vue/Svelte).

Backend: Any server (Node.js/Python/Go).

Charts: Library-agnostic (D3.js/Chart.js/Plotly).

6. Success Metrics
Engagement: Avg. time spent on tool exercises.

Adoption: # of exports/user/month.

Feedback: User ratings on content clarity.

Appendix: Wireframes available upon request.

Note to Replit Agent:

Stack-agnostic: Prioritize functionality over specific tech.

Scalability: Ensure modular design for future tool additions.

Accessibility: WCAG-compliant UI (keyboard nav, alt text).
